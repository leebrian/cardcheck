# cardcheck
Learning python by automating the price checks on my magic card collection. 

Training repo playing around with python3

## Thanks and references
Using the tooltip library from https://deckbox.org/help/tooltips to show card mouseovers
Using the table filter script from https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_filter_table.asp to quickly filter out stuff in the report that I do not care about.
