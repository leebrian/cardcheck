## Coding conventions

I'll document my coding conventions here. 

* lowerCamelCase for methods and variables. I think this is easier to read than pythons_underscore_convention
* sort of Hungarian notation as a helper for what kind of variable (eg, str,list, etc)
* indent with four spaces
* clean up a little bit with each edit
* explore language features over optimization, although maybe optimize late
